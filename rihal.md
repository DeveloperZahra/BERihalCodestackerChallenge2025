# Crime Management System – ASP.NET Core Web API

Backend API for managing crime cases, reports, evidence, and users for **District Core**.  
Built as part of the **BE Rihal Codestacker Challenge 2025 (Backend)** using **ASP.NET Core**, **Entity Framework Core**, and **JWT Authentication**.

---

## 🌍 Background
District Core is under siege — rising crime and failing trust have left the community on edge.  
To turn things around, officials launched a **Crime Management System**, enabling **real-time crime reporting** and faster **police response**.

Now, the officials need your expertise to develop a **robust backend API** to efficiently manage growing crime data, ensure security, and improve response times.

---

## 💡 Problem Statement
Develop a **backend API system** for a **Crime Case Management Platform**.  
This system enables registered users — **Admins**, **Investigators**, and **Officers** — to create, update, and monitor criminal cases, while citizens can report crimes publicly.  
The API ensures **data integrity**, **security**, and **scalability** with a seamless role-based experience.

## 🧩 System Architecture

| **Controller** | **Description** |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| `AuthController` | Handles registration, login, and JWT token authentication. |
| `UserController` | Admin-only user management (create, update, delete, assign roles & clearance). |
| `CrimeReportsController` | Public crime reporting and tracking endpoints for citizens. |
| `CasesController` | Create, update, list, and view detailed crime cases linked to reports. |
| `CaseAssigneesController` | Assign and manage officers and investigators on each case. |
| `ParticipantsController` | Manage suspects, victims, and witnesses within a case. |
| `EvidenceController` | Create, update, and delete (soft/hard) evidence records with audit logs. |
| `CaseCommentsController` | Internal discussion/comments between investigators and officers. |
| `CitizenSubscriptionsController` | Manage citizen email subscriptions to city alerts. |
| `AlertsController` | Send email alerts and safety announcements to the public. |

## 👥 User Roles and Permissions

| **Role** | **Permissions** |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Admin** | Full access to manage all users, cases, and reports. Can assign roles and clearance levels. |
| **Investigator** | Create, update, and close cases. Assign officers and manage evidence, suspects, victims, and witnesses. |
| **Officer** | View assigned cases, upload evidence, and update progress. Cannot delete or edit others’ entries. |
| **Citizen** | Public access — can report crimes and track their status using the report ID. |

🔐 **Clearance Rule:** Officers can only be assigned to cases with equal or lower authorization levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical).

## 🧭 System Flow

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 1️⃣ Citizen Flow (Public Access)
| **Action** | **Endpoint** | **Authentication** |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Report a crime | `POST /api/CrimeReports` | ❌ Public |
| Track report status | `GET /api/CrimeReports/TrackCrimeReport/{reportId}` | ❌ Public |
| Subscribe to alerts | `POST /api/CitizenSubscriptions/subscribe` | ❌ Public |
| Unsubscribe from alerts | `POST /api/CitizenSubscriptions/unsubscribe?email=...` | ❌ Public |

**Process:**
1. Citizen submits a crime report.  
2. System generates a `reportId` for tracking.  
3. Admins and Investigators are notified automatically.  
4. Citizen can track progress anytime using the report ID.

---

### 🕵️‍♀️ 2️⃣ Investigator Flow
| **Action** | **Endpoint** | **Role** |
|-------------|--------------|----------|
| Create case from report | `POST /api/Cases` | Investigator |
| Assign officers to case | `POST /api/CaseAssignees/AssignUser` | Investigator |
| Add participants | `POST /api/Participants/CreateParticipant` | Investigator |
| Add or remove evidence | `POST /api/Evidence/AddTextEvidence`, `DELETE /api/Evidence/SoftDeleteEvidence/{id}` | Investigator |
| Comment on a case | `POST /api/CaseComments/AddComment` | Investigator |

**Process:**
1. Investigator logs in via `/api/Auth/login`.  
2. Creates a new case linked to existing crime reports.  
3. Assigns officers according to clearance level.  
4. Adds suspects, victims, witnesses, and evidence.  
5. Posts comments and updates visible to the case team.

---

### 👮 3️⃣ Officer Flow
| **Action** | **Endpoint** | **Role** |
|-------------|--------------|----------|
| View assigned cases | `GET /api/Cases` | Officer |
| Upload image evidence | `POST /api/Evidence/AddImageEvidence` | Officer |
| Comment on a case | `POST /api/CaseComments/AddComment` | Officer |

**Process:**
1. Officer logs in.  
2. Views all assigned cases.  
3. Uploads image or text evidence.  
4. Adds comments to update investigators.  
5. Cannot delete or modify existing records.

---

### 👨‍💼 4️⃣ Admin Flow
| **Action** | **Endpoint** | **Role** |
|-------------|--------------|----------|
| Manage users | `POST /api/User`, `PUT /api/User/UpdateUserByID` | Admin |
| Assign roles and clearance | `PUT /api/User/AssignRole` | Admin |
| Delete user | `DELETE /api/User/DeleteUser/{id}` | Admin |
| Send community alert | `POST /api/Alerts/CommunityAlert` | Admin |

**Process:**
1. Admin logs in via `/api/Auth/login`.  
2. Manages all system users, roles, and permissions.  
3. Reviews all crime reports and active cases.  
4. Sends safety alerts to subscribed citizens.
